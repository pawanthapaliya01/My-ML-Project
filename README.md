# Machine learning courses that I took

This repository contains machine learning code and tutorials I followed from the Udemy course by LazyProgrammer.

Course Reference

[Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks in Python (Udemy)](https://deeplearningcourses.com/c/deep-learning-convolutional-neural-networks-in-python)

Project Structure

Each folder corresponds to different sections or topics from the course, including:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Image Classification
- Object Detection
- Transfer Learning
- and more...

 My Notes

- Implemented from scratch using NumPy and TensorFlow.
- Tested on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and custom image datasets.
- Trained models saved in `/models` folder.
